Bruce Dudek [bruce.dudek at albany.edu](mailto:bruce.dudek@albany.edu)  

`bcdstats` is a collection of probability distribution graphing, shiny, correlation testing, and regression information functions.  It is intended for students in the APSY510/511 classes at the University at Albany.

This repository is a test case for the author to learn github.  It is not yet ready to receive suggestions for changes.

The latest development version can be downloaded using the `devtools` package by executing these two lines of code:

if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github('bcdudek/bcdstats')
