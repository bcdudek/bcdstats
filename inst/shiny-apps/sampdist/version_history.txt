1.1 Jan 9, 2018 Initial Modification of Hardman's app, by Bruce Dudek
a.  restructure look (a superficial change)
b.  separate code into global, server, and ui files for ease of editing
c.  add capability for changing the mu and sigma of a normal curve to fit instructor's varying needs
d.  add validation checks on all inputs to check (for example, integer status), and limit range of input values
e.  change the overlaid uniform distribution so that sides of rectange are perceived as vertical
f.  make sure that APP	doesn't crash when input field is blank
g.  add about tab.

1.2  Jan 29,2018

The original app was structured to have much of its work in global.R.  Putting a large number objects in the
global environment created a host of impediments to extensions and would be major problem if the app is on a server where the
scheduler permits more than one user of the app in each R session (using shiny server).  The revision accomplished the following:

a.  large scale restructuring done largely by Jason Bryer
b.  moved critical components into server.R, giving more direct control over inputs from the client side.
c.  simplified code and reworked some programming logic
d.  structured the code so that adding in new statistics (e.g., "trimmed mean")
    or new distributions would be easier, in future revision.

1.3

reworked the "Draw Samples" button and the action related to changing the number of simulated samples drawn
a.  In ver 1.2 and prior, changing the "number of samples" entry reset  the whole simulation and cleared the current plot.
b.  Now, the number of samples can be changed without restarting the simulation and plot.  So, samples can be added in different increments.
E.g, one might start with sampling 1 sample at a time and then switch to 100 samples drawn after the pattern is understood.
c.  The Draw Sample buttone was relabeled to "Draw More Samples".
