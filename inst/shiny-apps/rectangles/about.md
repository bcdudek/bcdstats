## Tools for Statistics Instruction using R and Shiny
========================================================

Author:  Bruce Dudek at the University at Albany, with assistance from Jason Bryer (Excelsior College)

The simulation approach in this application simulates samples drawn from a bivariate normal distribution, where the means, sd's, rho, and n are specified by the user.  The randomly drawn sample results are displayed in XY scatterplots along with unique approaches to visualizing the connection between computations and the strength/sign of the correlation.

In particular, some of the simulations emphasize a visualization of the construction of the covariance statistic.

Built using <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny" target="_blank"> Shiny </a> by <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Rstudio </a> and <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>, the Statistical Programming Language.

The correlation/covariance simulation uses the <em>rmvnorm</em> function in the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvtnorm/index.html" target="_blank">mvtnorm</a> package in R.
