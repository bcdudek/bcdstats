## Uploading Data for the Bivariate Plotting Application
========================================================

<b>Still in the testing phases.  Contact B. Dudek if this app does not work for you.</b>

This app will permit the user to upload a .csv file that contains data to be displayed.  It needs to have at least two columns that represent the IV and DV, respectively.
It is very important to follow the instructions here.

The application will only accept a "comma separated text file (.csv).  It will work best if the number of rows (cases, or sample size) is less than 100.  

The csv file must have only a small number of variables.  The user can specify which variable to be used as the IV (X) and which is to be used as the DV (Y).

The first row in the csv file should contain the variable names (a "header") .  If you upload a .csv file without a header (and indicate that by unchecking the entry box on the sidebar), the variables to choose from will be listed as V1, V2, V3, etc, depending on their position in the .csv file.  It is best to use .csv files that include variable names as a header row.

The best approach would begin by creating a file in a spreadsheet such as this:<br>

<br><br>
Then save it as a .csv file.<br>
Open the csv file in a text editor and it should look like this:<br>
