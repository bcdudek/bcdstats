\title{Regression Information for lm class models}
\usage{
mrinfo(lm.fit, cilevel = 0.95, minimal = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lm.fit}{A \code{lm} class model object.}

\item{cilevel}{Confidence interval level.  Default is .95.}

\item{minimal}{specifies volume of returned information (see details). Default=T.}
}
\description{
The \code{mrinfo} function produces a wealth of additional information
on multiple regression models above and beyond what summary(), anova(),
and Anova() produce.
}
\details{
The function takes an \code{lm} fit object.  Supplemental information is
calculated for \code{lm} fit objects.  When \code{minimal=T} is specified,
a data frame of several indices (see values) is returned.  When \code{minimal=F},
a list of information, including the supplemental values is returned:
zero-order correlations, the coefficients table, confidence intervals for the
regression coefficients, type I SS anova table and type III SS Anova table.

Structure coefficients can be very helpful in interpretation of
\code{lm} models.  The are defined as the pearson correlation of each IV in
the model with the yhat vector.  See Thompson and Borello (1985), Cooley and Lohnes
(1971), Cohen and Cohen (2003) or Nimon et. al., (2008).

\section{Warnings}{


The \code{mrinfo} function is designed to work with multiple regression objects
where an intercept is estimated.  Models where the intercept is forced through
the origin ('no intercept' models) are problematic for interpretation of the
supplemental information listed above and it is not returned.  The specification of
\code{minimal=F} will still provide the list of items described above.

Simple regression models do not require the supplemental information, but the
user can specify \code{minimal=F} to obtain the longer list of detailed information.

Models with factor IV's may create situations where interpretation of the
supplemental indices is problematic.  This can easily happen with
coding schemes such dummy coding (indicator coding or \code{contr.treatment()}).
Often, suppressor effect can occur,
rendering interpretation of beta weights, partial and semi-partial correlations, and
particularly the unique and common variance proportions challenging.  The unique
proportion of variance index is calculated as the squrare of the semi-parital correlation
(appropriately).  But the common proportion is calculated as the difference between
this unique fraction and the squared zero order pearson correlation for that IV. When
suppressor effects arise because of patterns related to contrast coding schemes this
common proportion can be  found as a nonsensical negative quantity. Careful understanding
of one's model is required in these circumstances.
